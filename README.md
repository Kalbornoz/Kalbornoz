### Layton FEST site

## Description

This was a project that I made for work at Layton City. This was my first big experience working with Microsofts new framework Blazor, which is an extension of their .NETCore framework. It is mainly a static site that serves as a flyer for Layton City's FEST activity which takes place on fridays during the summer. I made it using Blazor Server Side as opposed to Blazor Web Assembly (or client side).
